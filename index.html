          <h2>About the League Randomizer</h2>
          <p>
            Randomize League of Legends champions with a role filter. You can select multiple roles
            at once, or just one (the choice is yours). You can also randomize the skin for
            individual champions. The roles assigned to each champion are based on
            <a href="">this list.</a> It combines data straight from the game client, as well as
            those statistically determined by third party analytics services. It is also possible to
            include/exclude champions from the pool (your browser will remember your selection) to
            customize your randomization further.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't intend for this page to be wildely used, it was made on a request from a friend
            and I saw it as a great opportunity to challenge myself to make a simple web app. New
            champions are added to the pool manually(because of the custom role assignment), but
            skins/images stays up-to-date automatically since they are fetched directly from the
            League API.
